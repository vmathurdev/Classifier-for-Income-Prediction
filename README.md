# Classifier-for-Income-Prediction
The problem of income inequality is prevalent in almost every country in the world including the United States. The government and the international institutions have been trying to reduce the income inequality and bring the people out of poverty. Economic upliftment of the poor has been the centre of policy making for different governments since decades. In fact, Economic well-being is one of the main criteria that assesses the welfare of a nation. This study aims to look at the problem of income equality in the United States and identifies the characteristics that are necessary to increase the income levels of an individual. This study applies the classification techniques of machine learning to determine the factors that affect the income. The goal is to build to a classifier to predict whether a person would earn more than $50k in a year or not based upon the certain characteristics. The data for the study has been taken from the UCI website
